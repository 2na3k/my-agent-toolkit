To generate the technical spec for a specific application, no need a complex workflow.

For example, I always do like "as a software architecture please generate for me the spec for the application using some kind of language bla bla" --> It should write me a markdown file for the techstack, architecture and implementation plan.

It helps me, maybe not for you.
